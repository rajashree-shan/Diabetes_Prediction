# Diabetes_Prediction
## Overview
This project identifies individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes by analyzing demographic, medical, and lifestyle data. Machine learning models are implemented and compared using both **scikit-learn** (Python) and **MLlib** (PySpark) to explore performance trade-offs between local and distributed computing.

## Objectives
- Preprocess and analyze large health datasets with PySpark.
- Apply and evaluate machine learning models using both scikit-learn and PySpark MLlib.
- Compare performance metrics across platforms.
- Identify high-risk populations based on factors like age, obesity, smoking, and lifestyle.

## Key Features
- Data processing pipelines in both PySpark and pandas
- ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more
- Performance evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC
- Visualizations of model performance and risk factor distributions

## Dataset
